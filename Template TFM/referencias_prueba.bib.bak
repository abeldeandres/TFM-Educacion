  abstract = {Student retention is an essential part of many enrollment management systems. It affects university rankings, school reputation, and financial wellbeing. Student retention has become one of the most important priorities for decision makers in higher education institutions. Improving student retention starts with a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using five years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset. The sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that the educational and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, educational centers are regarded as one of the most important buildings in cities; therefore, in the present study, the geographical suitability of the existing schools in two districts (6, 12) of Tehran Metropolitan, Iran, is studied using five standpoints including urban facilities, accessibility to urban road networks, population density, city services, and cultural centers. For this purpose, a stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) algorithm was applied to determine the importance of each subfactor. By use of “R” programming language, a combination of SWARA, radial basic function (RBF), and imperial competitive algorithm (ICA) was applied to eliminate SWARA gaps. Finally, five maps for factors, subfactors, and classes of each subfactor were developed. And, based on the location of existing schools and the final map, the site selection map for new schools in the two studied districts is presented. Also, the results showed that the percentage of schools in districts 6 and 12 in “good” areas was 24.30% and 40.80%, respectively. Therefore, the condition of schools located in district 12 is better than district 6. Additionally, the combination of the SWARA–RBF–ICA method rectified the SWARA method limitations and led to 5% more optimized results.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors that lead to success (or failure) of students at placement tests is an interesting and challenging problem. Since the centralized placement tests and future academic achievements are considered to be related concepts, analysis of the success factors behind placement tests may help understand and potentially improve academic achievement. In this study using a large and feature rich dataset from Secondary Education Transition System in Turkey we developed models to predict secondary education placement test results, and using sensitivity analysis on those prediction models we identified the most important predictors. The results showed that C5 decision tree algorithm is the best predictor with 95% accuracy on hold-out sample, followed by support vector machines (with an accuracy of 91%) and artificial neural networks (with an accuracy of 89%). Logistic regression models came out to be the least accurate of the four with and overall accuracy of 82%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that previous test experience, whether a student has a scholarship, student’s number of siblings, previous years’ grade point average are among the most important predictors of the placement test scores.},

  abstract = {Predicting students performance becomes more challenging due to the large volume of data in educational databases. Currently in Malaysia, the lack of existing system to analyze and monitor the student progress and performance is not being addressed. There are two main reasons of why this is happening. First, the study on existing prediction methods is still insufficient to identify the most suitable methods for predicting the performance of students in Malaysian institutions. Second is due to the lack of investigations on the factors affecting students achievements in particular courses within Malaysian context. Therefore, a systematical literature review on predicting student performance by using data mining techniques is proposed to improve students achievements. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview on the data mining techniques that have been used to predict students performance. This paper also focuses on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most important attributes in a students data. We could actually improve students achievement and success more effectively in an efficient way using educational data mining techniques. It could bring the benefits and impacts to students, educators and academic institutions.},

  abstract = {Ensemble methods and conventional base class learners have effectively been applied in the realm of educational data mining to ameliorate the accuracy and consistency in prediction. Primarily in the contemporary study, researchers conducted empirical results on pedagogical real dataset acquired from University of Kashmir, using miscellaneous base classifiers viz. j48, random forest and random tree, to predict the performance of students. However, in the later phase, the pedagogical dataset was subjected to more proficient version of stacking viz. stackingC, with the principle objective to ameliorate the performance of students. Furthermore, the dataset was deployed with filtering procedures to corroborate any improvement in results, after the application of techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and spread sub-sampling method. Moreover, in case of ensemble stackingC, hybridization of predicted output was carried out with three base classifier vis-a- vis j48, random forest and random tree, and the classifier achieved paramount accuracy of 95.65% in predicting the actual class of students. The findings have by and large noticeably corroborated that the stackingC classifier, attained significant prediction accuracy of 95.96% when undergone through undersampling (spread sub-sampling) and 96.11% using oversampling (SMOTE). As a subject of corollary, it calls upon the researchers to broaden the canvas of literature by employing the analogous methods to uncover the diverse patterns hidden in academic datasets.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a predictive analysis of the academic performance of students in public schools of the Federal District of Brazil during the school terms of 2015 and 2016. Initially, we performed a descriptive statistical analysis to gain insight from data. Subsequently, two datasets were obtained. The first dataset contains variables obtained prior to the start of the school year, and the second included academic variables collected two months after the semester began. Classification models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the school year for each dataset. Results showed that, though the attributes ‘grades' and ‘absences' were the most relevant for predicting the end of the year academic outcomes of student performance, the analysis of demographic attributes reveals that ‘neighborhood’, ‘school’ and ‘age’ are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.},

  abstract = {The capacity to predict student academic outcomes is of value for any educational institution aiming to improve student performance and persistence. Based on the generated predictions, students identified as being at risk of academic retention or performance can be provided support in a more timely manner. This study creates different classification models for predicting student performance, using data collected from an Australian university. The data include student enrolment details as well as the activity data generated from the university learning management system (LMS). The enrolment data contain student information such as socio-demographic features, university admission basis (e.g. via entry exam or past experience) and attendance type (e.g. full-time vs. part-time). The LMS data record student engagement with their online learning activities. An important contribution of this study is the consideration of student heterogeneity in constructing the predictive models. This is based on the observation that students with different socio-demographic features or study modes may exhibit varying learning motivations. The experiments validated the hypothesis that the models trained with instances in student sub-populations outperform those constructed using all data instances. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that considering both enrolment and course activity features aids in identifying vulnerable students more precisely. The experiments determined that no individual method exhibits superior performance in all aspects. However, the rule-based and tree-based methods generate models with higher interpretability, making them more useful for designing effective student support.},

The advancement in the data mining field makes it possible to mine educational data in order to improve the quality of the educational processes. This study, thus, uses data mining methods to study the performance of undergraduate students. Two aspects of students' performance have been focused upon. First, predicting students' academic achievement at the end of a four-year study programme. Second, studying typical progressions and combining them with prediction results. Two important groups of students have been identified: the low and high achieving students. The results indicate that by focusing on a small number of courses that are indicators of particularly good or poor performance, it is possible to provide timely warning and support to low achieving students, and advice and opportunities to high performing students.},

In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students' academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way.},

  abstract = {This review pursues a twofold goal, the first is to preserve and enhance the chronicles of recent educational data mining (EDM) advances development; the second is to organize, analyze, and discuss the content of the review based on the outcomes produced by a data mining (DM) approach. Thus, as result of the selection and analysis of 240 EDM works, an EDM work profile was compiled to describe 222 EDM approaches and 18 tools. A profile of the EDM works was organized as a raw data base, which was transformed into an ad-hoc data base suitable to be mined. As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of EDM approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict EDM approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the EDM approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed EDM works, and provides an analysis of the EDM strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled.},

This is due to the potential of data mining in analyzing and uncovering the hidden information of the data itself which is hard and very time consuming if to be done manually. The purpose of this review is to look into how the data mining was tackled by previous scholars and the latest trends on data mining in educational research. Several limitations of existing research are discussed and some directions for future research are suggested.},
